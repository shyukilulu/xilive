# Xi  

Xi is a musical pattern language inspired in Tidal and SuperCollider for
building higher-level musical constructs easily.  It is implemented on the Ruby
programming language and uses SuperCollider as a backend.

Xi is only a patterns library, but can talk to
[SuperCollider](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider) synths or MIDI
devices.

*NOTE*: Be advised that this project is in very early alpha stages. There are a
multiple known bugs, missing features, documentation and tests.

## Example

```ruby
melody = [0,3,6,7,8]
scale = [Scale.iwato, Scale.jiao]

fm.set degree: melody.p(1/2,1/8,1/8,1/8,1/16,1/8,1/8).seq(2),
       gate: :degree,
       detune: [0.1, 0.4, 0.4],
       sustain: [1,2,3,10],
       accelerate: [0.5, 0, 0.1],
       octave: [3,4,5,6].p(1/3),
       scale: scale.p(1/2),
       amp: P.new { |y| y << rand * 0.2 + 0.8 }.p(1/2)

kick.set freq: s("xi.x .ix. | xi.x xx.x", 70, 200), amp: 0.8, gate: :freq

clap.set n: s("..x. xyz. .x.. .xyx", 60, 61, 60).p.slow(2),
         gate: :n,
         amp: 0.35,
         pan: P.sin(16, 2) * 0.6,
         sustain: 0.25
```

## Installation

### Quickstart

You will need Ruby 2.4+ installed on your system.  Check by running `ruby -v`.
To install Xi you must install the core libraries and REPL, and then one or
more backends.

    $ gem install xi-lang

Available backends:

* xi-midi: MIDI devices support
* xi-superdirt: [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt) backend

For example:

    $ gem install xi-lang xi-superdirt

Then run Xi REPL with:

    $ xi

There is a configuration file that is written automatically for you when run
for the first time at `~/.config/xi/init.rb`. You can add require lines and
define all the function helpers you want.

### Repository

Becase Xi is still in **alpha** stage, you might want to clone the repository
using Git instead:

    $ git clone https://github.com/xi-livecode/xi

After that, change into the new directory and install gem dependencies with
Bundler.  If you don't have Bundler installed, run `gem install bundler` first.
Then:

    $ cd xi
    $ bundle install
    $ rake install

You're done! Fire up the REPL using `xi`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake test` to run the tests.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

You can also try things on the REPL without installing the gem on your machine
by doing `bundle exec bin/xi`.
